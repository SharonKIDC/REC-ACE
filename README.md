# Environment Installation
The environment is based on python 3.8.x, given the following paths you can install your virtual environment:  
- `<interpreter-path>` - the path to python 3.8.x interpreter  
- `<venv-root>` - a path where you'd like to install the virtual environment  
- `<project-root>` - a path where the code is cloned to

```Bash
`<interpreter-path>` -m venv `<venv-root>`
`<venv-root>`/Scripts/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r `<project-root>`/requirements.txt
```
